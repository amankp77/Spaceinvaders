# Space invaders with Pygame
### Video Demo: [My Project Live Demo](https://youtu.be/uVMq5Ih3Zx0)
### Description:
#### Hello everyone , I have created this project with the help of pygame (Python). Here you can play the game created by me. This is not the normal space envaders I have added some twist in the game so it is not going to be the normal Space invaders. In this project the player is basically a plane and your work is to kill all the aliens coming towards you. If any one of alien will touch the endline game will be over.There are score and High score is visible on top of the screen.There are three levels in the game. The first level is in between 1 tp 50 (score) and then Level 2 is in between 50-150 and then Level 3 the toughest one.
### History of [space invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)
#### pace Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. The aliens begin as five rows of eleven that move left and right as a group, shifting downward each time they reach a screen edge. The goal is to eliminate all of the aliens by shooting them.
### What is new in my space invaders
#### As I have mentiond in the short description this is not the normal space invaders in this the aliens are moving in Y direction so you should play it so quickly to catchup each and every alien.

### Images
#### I have used some enemy images which is bliting inside the games and all enemies images are in enemy directory. I have used an plane image as my player. there are also bullet and blast images for firing and explosion when the enemy is being killed by the bullet respectivly inside the music directory
### Souds
#### I have used four sounds in the game one is background music and the remaining three are for explosion,firing and gameover sound inside the music directory
### Font
#### I have used the squidofgames font. Credits are in the license.txt
